# Inventory-Management-and-Automation-EE381
A product-based project on an automated management system of any inventory.

## Abstract ##
Automated inventory management systems are evolving with the integration of advanced sensing technologies to enhance accuracy and efficiency. This paper presents an innovative approach utilizing infrared sensors and camera modules to automate the tracking of inventory interactions. The system employs infrared sensors to detect individuals entering and exiting inventory areas, and a camera module to capture and identify these individuals through facial recognition. By cross-referencing the identified individuals with a pre-existing database, the system ensures precise monitoring of inventory movement and personnel access.

## Steps for using this project:- ##

Please upload Inventory_manager_with_bluetooth.ino to Arduino Nano

and

Extract the zip file and copy the "ArduImageCapture" folder into your Arduino "tools" folder next to the Arduino "libraries" folder. If the "tools" folder doesn't exist, then you can create it yourself.

To use the camera module you can follow this link :
