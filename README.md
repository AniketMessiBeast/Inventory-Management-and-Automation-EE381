# Inventory-Management-and-Automation-EE381
A product-based project on an automated management system of any inventory.

## Abstract ##
Automated inventory management systems are evolving with the integration of advanced sensing technologies to enhance accuracy and efficiency. This project presents a simple and innovative approach utilizing infrared sensors and camera modules to automate the tracking of inventory interactions. The system employs infrared sensors to detect individuals entering and exiting inventory areas, and a camera module to capture and identify these individuals through facial recognition. By cross-referencing the identified individuals with a pre-existing database, the system ensures precise monitoring of inventory movement and personnel access.<br>

The importance of such an automated system lies in its ability to significantly reduce human error, and enhance the security of the room. This leads to improved resource allocation, cost savings, and increased overall efficiency within inventory management operations. 

## Steps for using this project:- ##

Please upload Inventory_manager_with_bluetooth.ino to Arduino Nano

and

Extract the zip file and copy the "ArduImageCapture" folder into your Arduino "tools" folder next to the Arduino "libraries" folder. If the "tools" folder doesn't exist, then you can create it yourself.

To use the camera module you can follow this link :
